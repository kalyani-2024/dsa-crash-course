## Time Complexity Quick Reference

```
O(1)       -> Hash lookup, array access, stack push/pop
O(log n)   -> Binary search, balanced BST, heap insert/remove
O(n)       -> Single loop, linear scan, BFS/DFS
O(n log n) -> Merge sort, quick sort, heap sort
O(n^2)     -> Nested loops, brute force pairs
O(2^n)     -> Subsets, recursion without memoization
O(n!)      -> Permutations
```

## Common Python Tricks

```python
# Infinity
float('inf'), float('-inf')

# Swap
a, b = b, a

# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# defaultdict (no KeyError)
from collections import defaultdict
graph = defaultdict(list)

# Counter
from collections import Counter
freq = Counter([1, 2, 2, 3])  # {2: 2, 1: 1, 3: 1}

# deque (O(1) both ends)
from collections import deque
q = deque([1, 2, 3])
q.appendleft(0); q.popleft()

# heapq (min-heap)
import heapq
heapq.heappush(heap, val)
heapq.heappop(heap)
heapq.nlargest(k, iterable)
# Max-heap trick: negate values
heapq.heappush(heap, -val)

# Sort with key
arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

# Enumerate
for i, val in enumerate(arr):

# Zip
for a, b in zip(arr1, arr2):

# String building (O(n) not O(n^2))
result = ''.join(char_list)  # correct
# NOT: result += char         # slow, O(n^2)

# Ceiling division
import math
math.ceil(a / b)
# Or: (a + b - 1) // b

# Binary -- useful for bit manipulation
bin(10)     # '0b1010'
10 & 1      # 0 (even)
10 | 1      # 11
10 ^ 10     # 0 (XOR cancels)
10 >> 1     # 5 (divide by 2)
10 << 1     # 20 (multiply by 2)

# Union-Find quick check
# parent[x] = x means x is a root
```
